Note: It doesn't look like this Repo shows anything really readable, it looks like it turned everything into raw .uasset files but I showed a little bit of what I worked on in the node window in the video submission.

Time Spent: About 10 hours, but probably over half of it was spend just learning how to set this stuff up and work in Unreal Engine. Implementing the hitmarker effect itself took about 2 hours.

Assets used: Everything you see here is based off of the Arena Shooter FPS preset provided with Unreal Engine as one of the starters.
